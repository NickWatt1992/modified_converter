Part 1. 
Use the given C# program to complete the tasks. Run and understand the current project. The program you have been given will already have the following functionality:
The Program will take in a unit of measurement and convert it to another unit of measurement.
The user will be shown a menu:
1.	Convert Centimetres to Inches
2.	Convert Metres to Feet
3.	Exit

If the user selects 1. 
The value (double) entered by the user in the Unit of Measure is converted from centimetres to a value (double) in inches and displayed.
If the user selects 2.
The value (double) entered by the user in the Unit of Measure is converted from metres to a value (double) in feet and displayed.

If the user selects 3. The program exits.
Part 2.
Extend Part 1.
In your groups you will now take the basic program and add in further units of measurement and convert it to another unit of measurement.
Examples such as
1.	Convert Centimetres to Inches
2.	Convert Metres to Feet
3.	Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
4.	Convert Centimetres to Feet
5.	Convert Kilometres to Miles

The UI can be either a GUI or console driven.
You must make use of Data Structures (arrays) in the code. You must make use of internal documentation (comments) and provide evidence of debugging (Screen shot of breakpoint being used).
